## [0.8a1] - 2025-05-19

This version includes **breaking changes** for credential providers. `BasicAuthCredentialProvider` has been deprecated and removed.
Please migrate to `ApiClientCredentialsProvider` if you haven't done so already. [Client credentials](https://developer.jamf.com/jamf-pro/docs/client-credentials) with API roles and clients is the recommended path forward.
Where basic auth is still required with username/password use `UserCredentialsProvider`. 

### Changed

- Update sort and filter fields for device inventory endpoints.
- Change default credential provider to `ApiClientCredentialsProvider` in docs.
- Refactored `LoadFromAWSSecretsManager`, `PromptForCredentials` and `LoadFromKeychain` into helper functions instead of classes. Each function returns a `CredentialProvider` type that is specified or raises a `TypeError` if an invalid credential provider was passed.

### Fixed

- GitHub Actions workflows now pin action versions to commit hash. Docs publishing was broken due to outdated actions.
